// Ratiorg got statues of different sizes as a present from CodeMaster for his birthday, 
// each statue having an non - negative integer size.Since he likes to make things perfect, 
// he wants to arrange them from smallest to largest so that each statue will be bigger than 
// the previous one exactly by 1. He may need some additional statues to be able to accomplish 
// that.Help him figure out the minimum number of additional statues needed.

//   Example

// For statues = [6, 2, 3, 8], the output should be
// makeArrayConsecutive2(statues) = 3.

// Ratiorg needs statues of sizes 4, 5 and 7.
